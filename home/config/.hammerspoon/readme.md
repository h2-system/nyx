# Yabai vs Amethyst

When I was building this configuration, there were issues with Yabai and 14.4 so I configured amethyst via brew instead.
Turns out, the yabai issue has to with moving windows to other workspaces, something amethysst does well.
So now I'm running both - amethyst with no active modes and yabai.
